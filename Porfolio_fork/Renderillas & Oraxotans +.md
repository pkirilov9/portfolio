Name - primate comparison etc. 

Basically a combination of all the notions that have been interesting to me in the past few years, which are the chapters you see here.

In a most unCADlike way. The computer is not used to prefigure built form, in the sense of presenting an anticipatory image exactly resembling it. The whole point of the topological turn is to catalyze newness and emergence rather than articulating universalized fixation. Of course, topological transformations are just as formalizable, in their own way, as are classical geometric forms. Chance must be added to truly yield change. The computer becomes a tool of indeterminacy. Abstract spaces are no longer neutral screens for imaging what has already been seen in the mind’s eye. They must be actively designed to integrate a measure of indeterminacy. [...] The design process takes on a certain autonomy, a life of its own.

There is no such thing as pure indeterminacy, certainly not in a programmed environment. Indeterminacy must be designed to emerge from an interplay of constraints.

The “impurities” of the everyday--personal taste, dirty function, preference enforced in part by social convention, and most vulgar of all, cost--enter the process, across the analogic gaps.

The originality of a cultural process is measured by the complexity and productiveness of the new problems it creates, not the neatness of its creative solutions. For in complexity there is life.
