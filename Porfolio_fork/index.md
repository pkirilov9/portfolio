<p align=center>*Welcome to my explorative repository!*</p>
<p align=center text-align: justify>*This is not exactly a portfolio... it is a field of exploration and experimentation that tracks my approach to architecture as an evolving process, where the orchestration of form gives way to the catalysation of potentials emergent from the engagement with the complex networks and interrelations that shape the architectural profession.* </p> 

I invite you to begin this journey with this visual allegory of my self-perception as a practitioner:

<p align=center >*Oscillating around the periphery of the architectural field, <p>

I have long been disillusioned with the propagated ideal of the architect as an autonomous master-creator, who artfully drops objects in the urban grid. No longer mesmerised by the promise of stellar recognition, and therefore validation, my focus shifted from the pristine architectural object, and its projected vision, towards the processes and networks it is entangled in. What followed was often accompanied by lots of blisters, cuts, matted hair, bruises, and blackened snot. However, what became truly valuable in this process of hands-on engagement and exploration was that I gained an understanding of architectural practice as the constant oscillation between becoming-major and becoming-minor. It is precisely this fluctuating nature of production that I am after. I have come to love the process of contamination of the major, elevated, pristine architectural ideal, conceived in isolation and rooted in the rational, with the minor, gritty, contingent reality of day-to-day practices and interrelations. 

Throughout this field of exploration, I aim to position myself as a professional through grounded examples, experiments, and actions rather than a sequence of polished speculative projects. Hence, I have chosen to break the journey into five interwoven themes: [[MAKING]], [[PERFORMATIVITY]], [[SYSTEMS > OBJECTS]], [[SOCIAL-IMPACTFUL-CONTEXTUAL]], and [[VISUAL CULTURE]]. Each topic serves as an entry point into the broader networks of thought, practice, and experimentation that define my evolving approach to architecture. These topics are not isolated but interconnected, forming a landscape of ideas that reflect my engagement with the discipline as a dynamic and process-driven field.


[[MAKING]]: 
I approach architecture as a practice of doing, an active process of tracing the flow of materials and the connections between parts, where form emerges through production rather than imposition. I engage with architecture from the middle (not to be confused with the centre), positioning myself in the midst of things, and embracing the messy, physical, and hands-on nature of the craft, as the interactions between forms often become more important than the forms themselves. 

![[201688fd819a4fbb9b67fabef9908048 1.mov]][[PERFORMATIVITY]]:
Performativity in architecture moves beyond static representations to encompass iterative, repeatable processes that make the intangible tangible. It is about understanding architecture not merely as an object, but as a practice of enacting, doing, and engaging with the forces that shape space. This approach reveals architecture’s capacity to transform and catalyse experiences through dynamic relationships, rather than fixed outcomes.

[[SYSTEMS > OBJECTS]]:
Architecture transcends the limits of the built form when we focus on systems rather than objects. I am interested in the processes that govern the profession and the ways in which architecture engages with broader political, social, and economic systems. This shift in focus redefines the role of the architect—not as a creator of isolated objects, but as a facilitator of relations, enabling new potentials within the spaces we inhabit.

[[SOCIAL-IMPACTFUL-CONTEXTUAL]]]:
At the core of my work is the belief that architecture must engage with the social realities of the people it serves. I strive to create architecture that has a direct, positive impact on communities. This requires the architect to be less of a detached visionary and a more engaged, responsive practitioner who prioritises human relationships and contextual realities.

[[VISUAL CULTURE]]:
In a world dominated by visual representation, architecture is often reduced to images—static, consumable icons detached from the processes that generate them. While I value the visual aspects of architectural production, I also seek to move beyond this surface, exploring how images can both shape and limit perception. My interest lies in how these visual representations interact with the wider ecology of media, memory, and meaning in architecture.
