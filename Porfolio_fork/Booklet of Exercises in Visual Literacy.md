This booklet is the outcome of the preliminary, theoretic exploration of the project [[Renderillas & Oraxotans +]]. Prompted by the problematics that come with the over-reliance on representational thinking within the realm of [[VISUAL CULTURE]], I created a “Booklet of Exercises in Visual Literacy,” which expands on the notion of elucidating by engaging in practices of seeing more and seeing differently. The exercises resemble primary school experiential learning and emphasise tacit, minor knowledge. Embodying the spirit of [[PERFORMATIVITY]], I see them as a distinctive form of hosting in the sense that they set up the context for an event to play out, allowing for the contingency of the surroundings to influence the outcomes instead of preemptively disclosing them beforehand.

I see those exercises as a distinctive form of sets in the sense that they set up the context for an event to play out. They provide the necessary conditions for things to happen, however, unlike common representational techniques, they involve a performative process, where, through enacting, the processes which condition their production become legible or perhaps palpable. Therefore, the archival entities are no longer regarded as static, unchangeable objects but processes that "incorporate the processual dynamics" of the performative and make them "accessible as re-usable data". Exercises hold the capacity to reengage subjects; they require interaction and, through it, aim to produce new forms of literacy which can enable critical thought. In the process, the emphasis is not on outcomes, but rather, following the points outlined in [[SYSTEMS > OBJECTS]], on understanding the relations within the systems we participate in.
