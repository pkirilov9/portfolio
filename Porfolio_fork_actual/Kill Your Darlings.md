“A Home is Meant to be Interpreted ... and Reinterpreted” was a communal housing project that followed the idea that a home is a constant maintenance project and the spaces should allow for continuous, various, and unpredictable use and misuse.

Inspired by my tutor Ana, who always kindly reminded me that there is a point where I should “kill your darlings”, I deleted all documents, files and materials associated with the project... an exercise in letting go and [[PERFORMATIVITY]].
