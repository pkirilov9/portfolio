Architectural endeavours seem forever caught up in reconciling the gap between the pull of hopes and dreams and the drag of material constraint. This cornerstone of architectural production, where the ambitious reach of our imaginations rubs against the rough edges of the world, has become a personal favourite of mine. I have grown to love the contamination of the pristine architectural ideals, often conceived in solitary confinement, with the uneven, imperfect conditions of the environments where human life is lived. Practice becomes most exciting and incisive in this productive antagonism between the two, which pushes towards unforeseen acts of reconciliation. My first steps in this direction were before I even started my professional education, back in 2017, when I volunteered for the [[Re-Boeritsa]] project, which comprised the renovation of a mountain hut in Vitosha, the mountain bordering my hometown Sofia.

The hylomorphic model of production, pervasive in the architectural sphere, constrains creative potential by imposing rigid thought patterns on the design process. It frames making as a linear projectâ€”beginning with a fixed idea, manipulating raw materials, and concluding with a predetermined form. In doing so, it enforces a top-down approach, where practitioners impose mental blueprints onto the physical world, neglecting the dynamic, emergent properties of materials and processes. This model limits active, responsive thought, reducing architecture to static outputs rather than engaging with the fluid, evolving realities of creation.

Contrary to hylomorphic dogmas, form is ever emergent rather than given in advance. Making is not about imposing a fixed design onto raw materials but about revealing the inherent potential within a dynamic world. Creation unfolds step by step, with each phase leading naturally into the next, often surpassing the original vision. Such was the case with the projects [[Bird's Nest]] and [[Polycarbonate Firefly]] whose qualities and meaning arose alongside their production due to the open communication between material, environment, and maker(s).

Practitioners who embrace this fluidity act as wayfarers, navigating the evolving nature of materials and shaping them in harmony with their continual transformation towards a purpose that evolves alongside the process.

I aspire towards a shift in emphasis in the architectural modes of production: from abstract formal description towards close attention to the operations of making. I find it exciting and much more resilient to let yourself grow into knowledge rather than having it handed down to you. In other words, to put yourself in positions where you can open up to new possibilities of being, rather than seeking closure. I felt that recently while exploring the viability of [[Timber-Concrete Joints]]. In scenarios like this, where form is emergent, the conduct of thought goes along with, and continually answers to, the fluxes and flows of the materials with which one works. In that sense, to participate in the world means to join in the processes of production and to indulge in a dynamic world of energies, forces and flows. As Sheets-Johnstone suggests, "thinking in movement" means that thought itself becomes kinetic, inseparable from the action of making. Tracing the materials' generative currents allows personal knowledge to emerge, not through detached articulation but through direct experience.

I see myself as a maker, capable of producing, active, skilled with my hands, and able to think on my feet, or, at the very least, I want to keep developing as such. Some of the things I have done were a bit mad, and they did not amount to anything, yet I remain convinced it is the best way for me to acquire the embodied knowledge which is so vital in any creative venture.
