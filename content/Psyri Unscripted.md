“Psyri Unscripted” is a group project aiming at the disruption of the homogenisation of space in one of Athens’ formal working-class neighbourhoods (Psyri). The project revolved around the notion of 'exo-identity' - the preexisting expectation of a place. The mental projections that arise from the exo-identity of a place can be referred to as images by proxy since they are produced individually yet are, in fact, mere recreations of already existing (concepts of) images. 

Psyri has been subject to rapid gentrification in recent years as trendy spots pop up all around the place. The former working-class neighbourhood has transformed into an eclectic backdrop for your next Instagram story. As its exo-identity solidifies in online media, facilitated by the dominance of [[VISUAL CULTURE]] and the proliferation of digital images, more and more people flock to get their expectations met. This creates a scripted narrative of the place and predetermines future developments favouring a monotonous type of businesses and users which are rapidly displacing the residents, altering the urban fabric of what used to be a vibrant, multicultural, residential neighbourhood.

The goal of the project was to identify the multitude of layers that Psyri was once home to, now subsisting only in its periphery, and find a way to reconcile them with the unstoppable wave called 'urban renewal'.

We approached this task in a speculative manner through the lens of [[PERFORMATIVITY]]. This double-sided piece utilised a grid as a generative tool, rather than a confining one, in order to stimulate unscripted moments and encounters through the act of folding. This enabled the possibility for otherwise distant, or opposing, topics to literally come closer and engage in productive conversation.
