Architecture, far from existing as isolated objects or static forms, is entangled in a web of systems that govern its production and impact. Material cycles, for instance, dictate the availability and environmental costs of resources like concrete, timber, and steel, while chains of production extend across global networks, tying architectural practice to market demands, labour forces, and geopolitical realities. Beyond physical materials, architecture also interacts with regulatory frameworks, software affordances, and proprietary products that shape both the design process and the final built environment. The overarching field of [[VISUAL CULTURE]] and the explosion of visual stimuli in contemporary media has interested me greatly. Its influence on architectural production has become ever more significant in the past few decades, which pushed me to explore this further. As a result, I came up with a [[Booklet of Exercises in Visual Literacy]], which delves into the topic through engagement and enactment of scenarios that reveal the underlying processes of image production.

Digging even further, I was interested in the tools we use as professionals to produce the precious images that quantify our labour. As professional media producers, our practices are tightly defined by the affordances of mainstream software applications and ecosystems. CAD and BIM softwares have become the bread and butter of our profession since they enable the production and proliferation of digital images, however, there is a total lack of transparency in their modes of operation, leaving us in awe of their "magical" capabilities. Determined to gain a better understanding of the systems that condition architectural production I wanted to elucidate the processes that go within those "magic boxes", which became the driving force behind the project [[Black Boxes, Pipelines, and Whatnots]].

These systems—ranging from the architectural canons that influence design traditions to the legal liabilities and profit-driven constraints of construction—reveal the complex field in which architects operate. It follows, that their role is not merely to produce objects but to engage with these multifaceted systems. Indeed, as Felix Guattari notes, the traditional notion of architecture as a singular, autonomous object is no longer sufficient. The architectural object, situated at the intersection of all these powerful forces and interests, is condemned to be ripped and pulled in every direction, making it useless to hold on to. The shift from object-focused architecture to systems-thinking redefines the role of the architect, moving away from the production of isolated, static forms towards a practice that engages with complex social, political, and economic systems. The emphasis shifts towards understanding the processes and interactions that give rise to architectural environments and how to influence them, making architecture a living system rather than a fixed object.

In theory, all of this sounded incredibly appealing to me, however, I wanted to know what it means to apply it in actual circumstances. Hence, I chose to investigate the systems in place in my local context - the socialist-modernist housing complexes in Sofia, Bulgaria. This process of investigation, interference, and disruption became the basis of the project [[Renderillas & Oraxotans]]. In this system-focused approach, form matters but it is not the primary concern. Instead, it emerges from the processes of deformation, movement, and growth. Unlike traditional models, where form was seen as both the raw material and the final product, this approach to architecture allows form to evolve out of dynamic interactions. These lines of growth and movement entangle and knot, always extending beyond themselves, reflecting the ongoing, never-complete nature of architectural practice. Architects, in this sense, are not merely designers of objects but facilitators of systems where forms emerge through the interactions of forces and elements within a broader, interconnected field.

Ultimately, as a result of this project, I became even more interested in work that transcends the physical object of architecture. It is my intention to continue to find ways to better my understanding and skills in order to do work which acknowledges and intervenes in the systems that condition architectural practice, as well as the processes that architectural practice enables.
