As a part of Tatiana Bilbao Estudio's exhibition team, I had the opportunity to be part of the curation and production of several exhibitions, one of them being 'En Comun' in the 'Aedes Gallery' in Berlin. The exhibition highlighted seven of the studio's projects through artefacts and collages that tackled the question of how we might become better at living together.

This project exemplifies [[VISUAL CULTURE]]'s stronghold over the field of architecture, as the profession increasingly revolves around imagery and representation. While this dominance can limit deeper exploration of materiality and spatial experience, it also offers an upside: the opportunity to engage with peripheral fields equally rooted in visual culture. Collaborations with the art world, galleries, and other creative industries open doors for cross-disciplinary experimentation, blending architectural practice with broader cultural narratives. This intersection encourages change, allowing architecture to evolve and respond to contemporary visual and artistic trends while expanding its impact across different fields.
