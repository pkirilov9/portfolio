'Zona B-5', constructed between 1977 and 1985, is the pinnacle of modernist housing in Bulgaria. Unparalleled in grandeur, construction innovation, and design ambition, this housing block consists of sixteen blocks, two kindergartens, one school, one nursing home, and a park and a shopping centre, which were realised around twenty years later. With the capacity to house and cater for seventeen thousand people, it is safe to say that it is a small city in itself. Built during the socialist regime in Bulgaria, the housing complex exemplified the ruling socialist party's intention to create a utopian, egalitarian community for all walks of life. 

Soon after the fall of the socialist regime in the late 80s, however, the dreams of a utopian society came crashing down, and together with it, the prestige of 'Zona B-5'. In the period between the 90s and the late 2000s, the neighbourhood experienced a period of 'ghettoisation', as some historians call it. Throughout the years it was subject to a great deal of change and neglect, which has resulted in a somewhat run-down, fragmented condition, where the rule "everybody for themselves" reigns supreme.  

In the following booklets, you can explore this complex condition for yourself and get familiar with the site.
