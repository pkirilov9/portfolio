Exploring the viability of concrete-timber joints started as an exercise in [[MAKING]]. Inspired by the series of airplane hangars designed by Pier Luigi Nervi, I wanted to re-imagine the next iteration, which would use far less concrete for its production and apply it where its pliability and strengths are required most - at the joints between the beams.
