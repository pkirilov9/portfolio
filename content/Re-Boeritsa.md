‘Re-Boeritsa’ is the culmination of the 2018 EASA INCM in Sofia, Bulgaria. I volunteered to help with the restoration of the Boeritsa hut located in the heart of Vitosha mountain that borders the city. This two-year-long endeavour comprised multiple workshops, lectures, gatherings and more.

For those two years, the hut became a home for an enthusiastic group of architects, students, and activists and provided them with the opportunity to make mistakes, learn by doing, engage with the real world, and take responsibility.

I am grateful to have had this opportunity as it allowed me early on in my career to get a first-hand impression of what [[MAKING]] means. To see all the material investment, to participate in the physical labour, to make decisions, and to take responsibility. It was also a great example of [[SOCIAL-IMPACTFUL-CONTEXTUAL]] architecture, carried out by a motivated, joyful, and active group of people.
