The idea for the title comes from the reduction of the architect's role in the contemporary workplace to that of a "CAD-monkey", which is a common professional joke that has been circulating media platforms. With the rise of Building Information Modelling (BIM), the joke has evolved into the "BIM-panzee," reflecting the profession's increasing reliance on automated, reductive processes. These primate comparisons reveal an implicit recognition of the monotonous, mechanised, and alienated nature of architectural practice. As visual representation and the production of affective imagery become more crucial, new "worker-primate" species, like the "Renderilla" and "Oraxotan", emerge, symbolizing shifts in contemporary architectural labour. Yet to be explored, they offer ground for new and exciting research into contemporary architectural labour and its modes of production that conditioned their occurrence. 

This project is subject to extensive theoretical research which explores the dominant representational modes of production that stifle contemporary practice. To dig deeper into these topics and to familiarise yourself with the concepts that have become foundational to the project, please visit the explorative repository, which also doubles as my diploma thesis: https://pkirilov9.github.io/renderillas-and-oraxontans/.

Through my research, I arrived at the notion of [[PERFORMATIVITY]], which became incremental to my approach as I followed the principles laid out in this diagram. The goal was to explore this counter-action and its viability in providing an alternative to the dominant representational norm. 

After careful consideration, I chose a socialist-modernist housing complex in my hometown Sofia, called 'Zona B-5' as the site for intervention. The goal of the proposal is to provide a feasible solution to the impasse that such housing blocks impose when it comes to energetic renewal. The extremely high percentage of private ownership, combined with institutional negligence, and a sense of sacrality of private property and interest, common to the region, has resulted in fragmentation and neglect. The governmental renovation programs that are in place have proven to be unsuccessful and problematic, hence my desire to come up with a [[SOCIAL-IMPACTFUL-CONTEXTUAL]] solution to the problem, which takes into account the complex meshwork of systems and interests that have led to this condition. To learn more about the site and its tremulous past and present condition go to [[ZB5 Background]].

From the very beginning, I wanted to start from the midst of things, from the complex, uncomfortable and problematic present, rather than referencing enshrined pasts, or projecting utopian futures. That meant following the principles laid out in [[SYSTEMS > OBJECTS]], which consisted of embedding myself in the conditions of the site in order to understand the forces at play first-hand rather than by analysing them from a distance. 

This approach, inspired by the action-oriented mindset of [[MAKING]], led to the organising of a communal event that aimed to instigate a conversation about the rundown condition of the courtyard, which is enclosed by the blocks, and to empower a general attitude of maintenance and care among the residents.

However, if the performative approach has any future viability, it requires modes of archiving and interpretative models that can analyse and historicise, which are just as capable of accommodating action and contingency. The alternative to the traditional representational archive is, of course, the "performative archive", where the archival entries should be accessible as reusable data that lends itself for further editing. So, for the concrete design proposal, I set myself the goal of enabling a physical performative archive which is capable of accommodating contingent forces, all the while providing the opportunity for a decentralised and democratised process of urban renewal which is stretched out in time. This resulted in a self-supporting exo-skeleton that will be attached to the structural elements protruding from the facade. This would allow for future renovation work to take place; it will strengthen the construction of the building, which has been compromised over the years; and it will highlight the defining architectural features which have faded over time.

An important part of the proposal is for the exo-skeleton to allow the preservation/renovation of the brick facade elements that are a defining architectural element. Therefore, I designed with the intention of providing a stacking system that does not require expert knowledge and can facilitate a DIY approach for residents who cannot afford a professional mason.

The performative architectural object resembles an open-ended conversation which acknowledges that shaping forces will come after the building is finished. Embracing the continuity of variation, built forms are seen as remnants of an evolving process, emerging from the contingency of events. In the words of Massumi, "the sign-form fundamentally means nothing", it is meant to stand at the threshold between processes". This upholds an understanding that does not regard buildings (or any architectural output) as "finished" upon its physical completion. Instead, they come to fruition, realising their full potential, in the minds and actions of those who engage with them.

An integral part of the project was to facilitate the renovation works of the facades by implementing a platform which can allow working from the outside without the need for demolition. This would provide a safe working environment as well as a mode for transportation of materials through an electric hoist which can be attached to the platform.

Embracing the idea of [[SYSTEMS > OBJECTS]], I opted for a representational mode that emphasises action over static objects. Borrowing the notion of 'transcripts' from Bernard Tschumi, I focused on making visible the processes that would be required for this proposal to come to fruition rather than simply rendering a projected vision of a "completed" version.

Finally, I wanted to come up with a performative way of presenting this intervention to possible users or institutions. This manifested itself in the form of a game which outlines various user profiles and possible facade solutions, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. This can make it easier for residents to analyse and choose a suitable option for them based on cost, functionality, and stylistic or ethical preference.

In the iterability of action, one can access more comprehensive, tacit knowledge that goes beyond representation. In action, you don't just understand concepts or objectsâ€”you feel and grow into the systems at play. This first-hand experience allows you to grasp the intangible, the things that words or drawings can't fully capture.
