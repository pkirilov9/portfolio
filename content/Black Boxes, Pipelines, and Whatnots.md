My exploration into the tools architects use to create began with an interest in how professional media, [[VISUAL CULTURE]], and particularly images, dominate our work. This led me to question how these tools shape the boundaries of what we produce, driving me to investigate their inner workings. Starting from John Hejduk's project 'Wall House II', my inquiry expanded as I read Albena Yaneva and Bruno Latour's essay "Give Me a Gun and I Will Make All Building Move," which examines the broader networks in which architecture operates. In parallel, VilÃ©m Flusser's work, "Towards a Philosophy of Photography," introduced me to the concept of "black boxes," devices whose internal processes remain hidden from the user, contributing to a lack of transparency in digital tools.

I was particularly drawn to how Flusser's notion of the "black box" applies to the CAD and BIM software systems that form the backbone of our profession. These platforms, while enabling the efficient production of images and drawings, obscure their operational mechanics behind sleek interfaces, offering what appears to be seamless functionality. But what lies behind this apparent magic? Following the ideas set out in [[SYSTEMS > OBJECTS]], understanding the techno-material realities of these tools became the driving force behind this project. The aim is not just to master their use but to expose their internal logic, to demystify the "magic" and to gain a deeper understanding of how these systems influence architectural practice. This inquiry into the invisible pipelines, algorithms, and workflows is at the heart of what has shaped my investigation.
