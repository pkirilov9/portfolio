This video, composed of [[Collages and Drawings]] made by myself, illustrates my frustration and fear of the path many young professionals end up on - stuck behind a desk, endlessly pouring creative content against the pressure of the clock. Although I understand the importance of image production and I pride myself on the quality and originality of the content I produce, I can't help but feel that the overemphasis on visuality is a key part of a wider system which reduces architecture to a commodity, a spectacle that further fortifies the ever so present attention economy. In a profession so dominated by the image, it becomes essential to question how much of architecture is being dictated by the visual, what systems uphold and maintain the networks in which it proliferates, how it informs perception, and how it homogenises virtual, and thereafter, physical space - questions which I explore in the [[Booklet of Exercises in Visual Literacy]] and [[Black Boxes, Pipelines, and Whatnots]].

The dominance of the visual in architecture has an overwhelming grip on the field, shaping not only the production process but also the perception and remembrance of architectural work. Architecture today often collapses into easily digestible images, reduced to icons that proliferate within a vast ecology of visual media. These images do more than represent, they mediate how we conceive of architecture, reinforcing a feedback loop between perception and production. Architectural images are not neutral, they are constructed, and in turn, they reconstruct the viewer. This reciprocal relationship, as Gilbert Simondon suggests, is not a simple transmission of information but a "transduction"—a process where both sender and receiver are changed by the communication. Our engagement with these images moulds our understanding, subtly directing how we interpret space, form, and functionality. They archive, codify, and delimit how we remember and perceive, creating a highly curated and somewhat flattened understanding of architectural possibilities.

Although the over-dependence on visuality in architecture has its drawbacks, there are also positive aspects to this engagement. The dominance of imagery has opened up interdisciplinary connections between architecture and peripheral fields such as visual studies, art, media, and even social sciences. This fosters a richer dialogue and a more integrated understanding of space and culture. This is evident in the involvement of many architecture offices in the curation and production of exhibitions, which I also had the pleasure of doing. I was part of the Tatiana Bilbao Estudio team that organised the [[En Común Exhibition]] in the Aedes Gallery in Berlin.

Moreover, the use of imagery can be reoriented to be productive rather than confining. By critically engaging with visual media, architects can subvert the limitations of the image. The group project [[Psyri Unscripted]] aimed to do just that by investigating the public image of architecture built around the proliferation of digital images in various media platforms. Much of what is considered to be the expectation of a built environment can be called its exo-identity. An exo-identity is a mental projection or an image of a place, an expectation composed from sources other than direct experience.  Exo-identities are created and consist of expectations that need to be met, but will never truly fit their premise. The exo-identity is thus continuously reaffirmed and recreated over and over again by those who are in need of seeing their expectations met, creating a scripted and predictable experience of place.

As part of the [[Psyri Unscripted]] project, we developed a foldable leaflet that can generate unscripted ideas and encounters by bringing unfamiliar or opposing demographics, places, and uses closer to each other. Thereby, it opened up the possibility for the one folding the leaflet to imagine unscripted interactions and new modes of being.
