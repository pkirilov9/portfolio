It is my understanding that architectural representation has spiralled into a rigid, self-referential, alienating practice which tends to rely on fixed essences to guarantee rightness, systematically excluding any socio-political, environmental, personal, or economic intricacies. So, if we accept that the aesthetic norms of representational modes of production delimit contemporary practice, in the notion of performativity I see a counter-action. It can work to "unframe" the messy embodiment that constitutes our relationship to spaces and things.

Performativity widens the scope of perception of architectural documentation and archiving. It prioritises practice, [[MAKING]], and action over results. This approach aims to distance itself from the polished and static architectural image-object and emphasises the importance of the relational activities that take place in a network, rather than the singularities that it consists of. The goal is to resist the ubiquitous totalising images and stabilising equilibriums in order to make architecture more gesture than reference, more speaking than speech. This opens up architectural work as social practice to the relations and interrelations—the performances of everyday life and culture—in which they are embedded. Doing in this context is not about reaching a final destination or the production of finished objects, it is about setting things in motion where one action can lead to the next. In the process, the norms and values that have brought the system, process, or place to a standstill can be questioned, examined, and reconsidered. This approach was embraced in the group project called [[Psyri Unscripted]], where the goal was to condition unscripted interactions within the urban environment.

The performative approach provides an alternative to the traditional way of production, where architectural output is conditioned by the application of hylomorphic schemas and rigid representational means over the open systems that comprise our lived spaces, in order to reduce them to something orderly, predictable, and manageable in advance. Rather than to resemble, it seeks to disassemble. It makes the interrelations and complexity of the open systems, in which architecture is nested, sensible by emphasising experiential potential. This implies the understanding of [[SYSTEMS > OBJECTS]], where what becomes valuable is the understanding of the links between the individual nodes and the relationships they constitute within this wider system, rather than the nodes themselves. Performativity aims to give us a sense of the ephemeral, the fleeting, and the not-quite-graspable. Such was my goal when I was compiling a [[Booklet of Exercises in Visual Literacy]], where I wanted to expose the obscured overarching systems and frameworks that condition architectural representation, through a series of exercises.

One way to apply this theoretical framework is by creating "performative archives" - places where the archival entries should be accessible as reusable data that lends itself to further editing. In the process of addition, reproduction, and alteration, such structures allow for the possibility of contesting co-utterances. As a result, the project attains new meaning as a dynamic and elastic frame that can produce and support a series of projects that are a part of it. This was indeed the concept for my graduation project [[Renderillas & Oraxotans]], where I proposed a physical performative archive which can constitute new processes and modes of thinking that address the urgent topic of energetic renewal of socialist-modernist housing blocks.

Performativity, in architecture, treats buildings as open-ended processes rather than finished products. Architectural forms become remnants of ongoing interactions, acknowledging that shaping forces continue long after construction. This approach dismantles the ego of the creator, embracing a fluid process where ideas and influences shift over time. A process which is not familiar or desirable to many professionals in the field. I was intrigued by this and tested it myself in the liberating exercise called [[Kill Your Darlings]].  By moving beyond preconceptions, architects can liberate their work, allowing it to evolve and breathe, continuously responding to its surroundings and context.
